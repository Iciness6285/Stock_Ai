script_path = your/path/to/stock_ai_scripts
data_path = your/path/to/stock_ai_data

Replace the paths with your own paths where you have saved the script, and data folder.
The script path must be in line 1, the data path in line 2 of this text file.

In my case, the paths looked like this:
script_path = /mnt/c/Users/flore/OneDrive/programs/stock_ai_scripts
data_path = /mnt/c/Users/flore/Dokumente/python/stock_ai_data
